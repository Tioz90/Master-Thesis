@article{Schreiber2017,
abstract = {We present pomegranate, an open source machine learning package for probabilistic modeling in Python. Probabilistic modeling encompasses a wide range of methods that explicitly describe uncertainty using probability distributions. Three widely used probabilistic models implemented in pomegranate are general mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Bayesian networks. A primary focus of pomegranate is to abstract away the complexities of training models from their definition. This allows users to focus on specifying the correct model for their application instead of being limited by their understanding of the underlying algorithms. An aspect of this focus involves the collection of additive sufficient statistics from data sets as a strategy for training models. This approach trivially enables many useful learning strategies, such as out-of-core learning, minibatch learning, and semi-supervised learning, without requiring the user to consider how to partition data or modify the algorithms to handle these tasks themselves. pomegranate is written in Cython to speed up calculations and releases the global interpreter lock to allow for built-in multithreaded parallelism, making it competitive with---or outperform---other implementations of similar algorithms. This paper presents an overview of the design choices in pomegranate, and how they have enabled complex features to be supported by simple code.},

@article{Shimony1994,
abstract = {Given a probabilistic world model, an important problem is to find the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) instantiation of all the random variables given the evidence. Numerous researchers using such models employ some graph representation for the distributions, such as a Bayesian belief network. This representation simplifies the complexity of specifying the distributions from exponential in n, the number of variables in the model, to linear in n, in many interesting cases. We show, however, that finding the MAP is NP-hard in the general case when these representations are used, even if the size of the representation happens to be linear in n. Furthermore, minor modifications to the proof show that the problem remains NP-hard for various restrictions of the topology of the graphs. The same technique can be applied to the results of a related paper (by Cooper), to further restrict belief network topology in the proof that probabilistic inference is NP-hard. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Marinescu2006,
abstract = {The paper introduces an AND/OR search space perspective for graphical models that in-clude probabilistic networks (directed or undirected) and constraint networks. In contrast to the traditional (OR) search space view, the AND/OR search tree displays some of the independencies present in the graphical model explicitly and may sometimes reduce the search space exponentially. Indeed, most algorithmic advances in search-based constraint processing and probabilistic inference can be viewed as searching an AND/OR search tree or graph. Familiar parameters such as the depth of a spanning tree, treewidth and pathwidth are shown to play a key role in characterizing the effect of AND/OR search graphs vs. the traditional OR search graphs. We compare memory intensive AND/OR graph search with inference methods, and place various existing algorithms within the AND/OR search space.},
