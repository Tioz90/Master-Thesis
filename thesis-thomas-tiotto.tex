\chapter{Literature review}\label{chap:literaturereview}
What is explainability?
How is it defined?  By whom?  When?
Why is it important?
Notable works in the field

Suggestions  when  collecting  references:

Copy  everything  in  one  document  (  with  references  !),  but  do  not  use it  directly  when  writing  the  text 
 
Copy it in  the  document  (  with  references  !)  and  color it  ,  but  do  not  use it  directly  when  writing  the  text   

What  is  the    main  point  of  the  sentence  /  paragraph  /  article  ?  

What    do I  want  to  convey  ?  

Read a  few  references  /  paragraphs  and  only  then  write  it  down

%%%% METHODOLOGY
%%%%

\chapter{Methodology}\label{chap:methodology}
The methodology section of a research paper answers two main questions:

1. How was the data collected or generated?

2. Which methodology was used to analyze it?

In writing the methodology chapter, explain the methodology you are using and why you chose it. Your reader needs to know the method you used to get your data because it effects your findings, and how you interpret your findings. It can be helpful to think of this piece as a ''manual'' - write so that someone can pick up your paper and do the same work you have done. Be direct and precise.

Your methodology is crucial to the quality of your research. It is important that the methodology is appropriate and your reasons for selecting it are clear. You should follow accepted practices; there is no need to re-invent a method. Your literature review can help you determine the method to use.

What  goes  into  Methods  chapter  ?  

It  is  all  about  HOW  you  will  do  the  study   What  is  the  method  ?  

What  does NOT go  into  Methods  chapter  ?
